This is my debut blog post. The learning curve just to get to this point was Everest-like. The journey I took to get this first post into your inbox, kind reader if you will take the time to share a minute with me, was considerable and not without intellectual hardship.

I got tired of being trolled on social media platforms just because I don't "fit in" to the dominant way of thinking. It seems today if you don't follow a "politically correct" doctrine, you will be pilloried for not towing the line. Every word you write must be checked for racism, sexism, and heaven forbid you joke about trannies. This is totally oppressive and in my opinion, never what the left wing ever intended to allow to happen. 

In my opinion the Internet which meant huge things to me has morphed out of control from the exciting liberating experience it once was for me in a sweaty office in Bangor University in 1988 where I sent my first email, to the oppressive, commercialised trollfest surveillance swamp it is today. This is my humble attempt to Drain the internet Swamp. The difference is I am the author of every single word on here. I own the words. Yet not only that...

My views waver between elements of David Icke (though not all of it!), anarchism, self-sufficiency and what I understand of geopolitics. Those who know me know I spent time in the Arabian Gulf so have an honest opinion on Islam which isn't black and white. 

The blog, which is entirely self-programmed, contains under each post a comment section which I'm keen to get running. That's also moderated by me, so no unsavoury stuff can get through! The only rule down there is - keep it entertaining!
